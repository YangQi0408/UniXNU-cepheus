"""Relax the clang diagnostics the older Mu trees cannot satisfy.

EDK II reads its compiler flags from Conf/tools_def.txt, which the UniXNU build
driver seeds from BaseTools/Conf/tools_def.template *only when the file is
absent*. So a pre-seeded, edited tools_def.txt survives and is what the build
uses.

The Aloha revisions that still carry the full cepheus device assets predate
modern clang, and their code calls AllocatePool/FreePool/strtoul and friends
with no declaration in scope. clang makes an implicit declaration an error
since C99 mode became the default, and -Wno-error does not reach the target
toolchain, so the flags have to go here.

usage: python3 relax_clang.py <tools_def.txt>
